while runnign the migration getting some error as user doesn;t have acces

so db.gradle creates service-key which is being used to create conenction  (pen tunnel) and run migration but somehow it was not working for the migration part for movies-database so
we used cf-mqsql keys in db.gradle instead of flyway-migration-key

Few good commands:

./gradlew :da:mo:cfMigrate --> runs only migration for movies-database

cf dsk movies-database flyway-migration-key --> delete service key

cf csk movies-database flyway-migration-key --> creates service-key

jobs --> shows detaisl of the job running
Kill %1 --> kills the first job

bg - background jobs

Note:

Flyway migration creates a table with name flyway_schema_history that gives details of the past migration.

build.gradle under database (both for movie/album) Line 31 --> giving 5 sec only but if there are internet issues - can give you timed out error so incrase this time 

  sleep 5_000L -->   sleep 30_000L
